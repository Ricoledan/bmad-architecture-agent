# Serverless Architecture Pattern

## Overview

Serverless architecture is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers. The cloud provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. In 2025, serverless has evolved to support complex enterprise workloads with improved performance, enhanced security, and better cost optimization.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios
- **Event-driven applications** with unpredictable or variable workloads
- **Microservices architectures** requiring independent scaling and deployment
- **Data processing pipelines** with batch or stream processing requirements
- **API backends** with sporadic traffic patterns
- **IoT applications** processing millions of events
- **AI/ML workloads** requiring elastic compute resources
- **Development and testing environments** with intermittent usage

### Avoid When
- **Long-running processes** exceeding serverless execution limits
- **Applications requiring persistent state** across invocations
- **High-frequency, consistent workloads** where containers are more cost-effective
- **Legacy applications** with complex dependencies
- **Real-time applications** requiring extremely low latency (sub-millisecond)

## 2025 Serverless Evolution

### Enhanced Performance Features
- **Cold start optimization**: Sub-100ms cold starts for most runtimes
- **Provisioned concurrency**: Pre-warmed functions for critical workloads
- **Custom runtimes**: Support for any programming language or runtime
- **ARM-based functions**: Graviton3 processors offering 20% better price-performance
- **WebAssembly support**: Near-native performance for compute-intensive tasks

### Advanced Scaling Capabilities
- **Predictive scaling**: AI-driven scaling based on usage patterns
- **Burst concurrency**: Instant scaling to thousands of concurrent executions
- **Geographic scaling**: Automatic deployment across multiple regions
- **Multi-cloud scaling**: Workload distribution across cloud providers

### Enhanced Security
- **Zero-trust networking**: Built-in network isolation and security
- **Runtime security**: Real-time threat detection and response
- **Supply chain security**: Verified container images and dependencies
- **Confidential computing**: Encrypted execution environments

## Architecture Components

### Compute Services
- **Function as a Service (FaaS)**: Event-driven compute execution
- **Container Functions**: Containerized serverless workloads
- **Serverless Kubernetes**: Managed container orchestration without nodes
- **Edge Functions**: Compute at edge locations for ultra-low latency

### Event Sources and Triggers
- **HTTP APIs**: RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous message processing
- **Event Streams**: Real-time data stream processing
- **Database Events**: Triggered by database changes
- **File Events**: Triggered by file uploads or modifications
- **Scheduled Events**: Time-based or cron-like triggers

### Data and Storage
- **Serverless Databases**: Auto-scaling databases with pay-per-use pricing
- **Object Storage**: Infinite scale storage with event triggers
- **In-Memory Caches**: Serverless caching solutions
- **Search Services**: Managed search and analytics
