# GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) Compliance Framework

## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that came into effect on May 25, 2018, across the European Union. It applies to any organization processing personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located.

## Key Principles

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently in relation to the data subject.

**Cloud Architecture Implications**:
- Implement audit logging for all data processing activities
- Provide clear data processing notices and consent mechanisms
- Ensure data processing purposes are clearly documented

### 2. Purpose Limitation
Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.

**Cloud Architecture Implications**:
- Implement data classification and tagging systems
- Design purpose-specific data storage and processing workflows
- Prevent unauthorized data usage through access controls

### 3. Data Minimization
Personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the processing purposes.

**Cloud Architecture Implications**:
- Implement data collection governance and validation
- Design systems to collect only necessary data fields
- Regular data audits to identify and remove unnecessary data

### 4. Accuracy
Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date.

**Cloud Architecture Implications**:
- Implement data validation and correction mechanisms
- Design update and rectification workflows
- Maintain data quality monitoring and alerting

### 5. Storage Limitation
Personal data must be kept only for as long as necessary for the processing purposes.

**Cloud Architecture Implications**:
- Implement automated data retention and deletion policies
- Design lifecycle management for different data types
- Create audit trails for data deletion activities

### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality
Personal data must be processed securely using appropriate technical and organizational measures.

**Cloud Architecture Implications**:
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Design comprehensive access control and authentication systems
- Establish security monitoring and incident response procedures

### 7. Accountability
Organizations must demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles.

**Cloud Architecture Implications**:
- Implement comprehensive audit logging and reporting
- Design compliance monitoring and dashboard systems
- Maintain documentation of all data processing activities

- **Encryption**: Protect data confidentiality and integrity
- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based and attribute-based access

```yaml
privacy_technologies:
  pseudonymization:
    techniques:
      - Tokenization with secure token vaults
      - Hash-based pseudonymization
      - Format-preserving encryption
  
  anonymization:
