## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Right-Sizing
1. **CPU Utilization Analysis**: Identify over-provisioned instances
2. **Memory Usage Patterns**: Optimize memory allocation
3. **Storage Utilization**: Eliminate unused volumes and optimize IOPS
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Optimize data transfer costs

### Reserved Capacity Planning
1. **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Identify stable, predictable workloads
2. **Commitment Strategy**: Mix of 1-year and 3-year reservations
3. **Instance Family Flexibility**: Choose convertible options where appropriate
4. **Payment Options**: All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront analysis

### Auto-Scaling Optimization
1. **Scaling Policies**: Time-based and metrics-based scaling
2. **Instance Mix**: Combine On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances
3. **Warm-up/Cool-down**: Optimize scaling response times
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic efficiently across instances

### Storage Optimization
1. **Tiering Strategies**: Implement intelligent storage tiering
2. **Lifecycle Policies**: Automate data archival and deletion
3. **Compression**: Enable compression for applicable data types
4. **Deduplication**: Eliminate duplicate data where possible

## Cost Monitoring & Governance

### Cost Allocation & Tagging
- Implement consistent tagging strategies for cost allocation
- Create cost centers and budget allocations by business unit
