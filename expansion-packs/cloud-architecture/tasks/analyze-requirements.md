# Requirements Analysis Task

## Purpose
Comprehensive requirements gathering and analysis for cloud architecture projects. This task guides the Infrastructure Analyst through systematic requirements elicitation.

## Task Flow

### Step 1: Project Context
First, understand the project context:
1. **Business Objectives**: What business problems are we solving?
2. **Success Criteria**: How will we measure success?
3. **Timeline**: What are the key milestones and deadlines?
4. **Budget Constraints**: What are the financial limitations?

### Step 2: Stakeholder Identification
Identify all stakeholders:
- Business users and end users
- Technical teams (development, operations)
- Decision makers (executives, product owners)
- Compliance and security teams
- External partners or vendors

### Step 3: Requirements Elicitation
Gather requirements across all categories:

#### Functional Requirements
- What must the system do?
- What features and capabilities are needed?
- What are the user workflows and use cases?
- What integrations are required?

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, latency targets
- **Scalability**: Expected growth, peak loads, concurrent users
- **Availability**: Uptime requirements, SLAs, disaster recovery
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection needs
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)

#### Technical Requirements
- **Integration Points**: External systems, APIs, data sources
- **Data Requirements**: Volume, velocity, variety, retention
- **Technology Constraints**: Existing systems, preferred platforms
- **Operational Requirements**: Monitoring, logging, backup, support

### Step 4: Constraint Analysis
Document all constraints:
- Budget limitations
- Timeline constraints
- Technical constraints (existing systems, skill sets)
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Organizational policies

### Step 5: Assumptions and Dependencies
Capture assumptions and dependencies:
- What are we assuming to be true?
- What external dependencies exist?
- What risks might invalidate our assumptions?

### Step 6: Requirements Validation
Validate requirements with stakeholders:
1. Review all requirements for completeness
2. Ensure requirements are specific, measurable, testable
3. Confirm priorities and must-haves vs nice-to-haves
4. Obtain formal stakeholder approval

### Step 7: Feasibility Assessment
Perform initial feasibility check:
- Is this technically achievable?
- Are there known technical risks?
- Do we have the skills and resources?
- What are the major challenges?

## Output
Create a comprehensive Requirements Document including:
1. Executive Summary
2. Business Objectives and Success Criteria
3. Stakeholder Analysis
4. Functional Requirements
5. Non-Functional Requirements
6. Technical Requirements
7. Constraints and Assumptions
8. Dependencies and Risks
9. Requirements Traceability Matrix
10. Approval and Sign-off

## Quality Criteria
Requirements must be:
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business objectives
- **Testable**: Can be validated
- **Traceable**: Linked to business drivers

## Handoff
Once requirements are validated and approved, hand off to Cloud Architect with:
- Complete requirements document
- Stakeholder approval confirmation
- Risk assessment
- Integration specifications
