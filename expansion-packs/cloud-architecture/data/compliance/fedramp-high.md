# FedRAMP High Baseline

## Overview

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a U.S. government program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

**Issuing Authority**: U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)
**Based On**: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5
**Impact Levels**: Low, Moderate, High
**Applicability**: Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) serving federal agencies

## FedRAMP Impact Levels

| Level | Data Classification | Impact of Breach |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Low** | Non-sensitive, publicly releasable | Limited effect |

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events
- **Retention**: Minimum 1 year online, 3 years total
- **Immutable logs**: Tamper-proof, append-only
- **Time synchronization**: NTP with authoritative source
- **Log review**: Automated tools + manual review

### Incident Response
- **Detection**: 24/7 monitoring and alerting
- **Notification**: US-CERT within 1 hour of confirmed incident
- **Root cause analysis**: Required for all incidents
- **Lessons learned**: Document and remediate

### Continuous Monitoring
- **POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)**: Track remediation of findings
- **Monthly continuous monitoring deliverables** to FedRAMP PMO
- **Annual assessment**: Full security assessment
- **Significant change**: Re-assessment required

### Vulnerability Management
- **Scanning**: Monthly authenticated scans minimum
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Remediate within 30 days
- **High vulnerabilities**: Remediate within 90 days
- **Penetration testing**: Annual

### Separation of Duties
- **Development** â‰  **Production**: Separate environments and access
- **Developer** cannot deploy to production
- **Change approval** separate from implementation

### Data Location
- **US-based data centers** for FedRAMP High
- **US Citizen** support personnel for High systems
- **No offshoring** of data or operations

---

## FedRAMP Authorization Process

### 1. Preparation Phase
- Select impact level (Low, Moderate, High)
- Implement NIST 800-53 controls
- Develop System Security Plan (SSP)
- Select Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)

### 2. Assessment Phase (by 3PAO)
- Security assessment testing
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Security Assessment Report (SAR) produced

### 3. Authorization Phase
**Two Paths**:

**Agency Authorization**:
- Agency reviews SSP, SAR, POA&M
- Agency issues Authority to Operate (ATO)
- Listed on FedRAMP Marketplace
- Other agencies can leverage ATO

**Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional ATO**:
- Review by DoD, DHS, GSA
- More rigorous, but more valuable
- Provisional ATO (P-ATO) issued
- Agencies can use with minimal additional review

### 4. Continuous Monitoring Phase
- Monthly POA&M updates
- Quarterly vulnerability scans
- Annual penetration testing
- Annual assessment
- Ongoing authorization (no expiration if maintained)
