# ISO/IEC 27001 - Information Security Management System (ISMS)

## Overview

ISO 27001 is an international standard for managing information security. It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Issuing Authority**: International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
**Current Version**: ISO/IEC 27001:2022
**Certification**: Third-party audited and certified
**Applicability**: All organizations seeking information security best practices

## ISMS Framework

### Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle

1. **Plan**: Establish ISMS, define scope, conduct risk assessment
2. **Do**: Implement controls and processes
3. **Check**: Monitor and measure performance
4. **Act**: Maintain and improve ISMS

## Risk Assessment and Treatment

### Risk Assessment Process
1. Identify assets
2. Identify threats and vulnerabilities
3. Assess likelihood and impact
4. Calculate risk level
5. Prioritize risks

### Risk Treatment Options
- **Avoid**: Eliminate risk by not performing activity
- **Reduce**: Implement controls to mitigate risk
- **Transfer**: Outsource or insure against risk
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and accept residual risk

---

## Key Implementation Steps

1. **Define Scope**: Determine what the ISMS will cover
2. **Conduct Risk Assessment**: Identify and assess information security risks
3. **Develop Risk Treatment Plan**: Select controls to address risks
4. **Create Statement of Applicability (SoA)**: Document controls selected
5. **Implement Controls**: Deploy technical and organizational controls
6. **Train Employees**: Security awareness and training programs
7. **Monitor and Measure**: Track metrics and KPIs
8. **Internal Audit**: Regular audits to verify effectiveness
9. **Management Review**: Senior management review of ISMS
10. **Certification Audit**: External audit for ISO 27001 certification

---

## Certification Process

1. **Stage 1 Audit** (Documentation Review): Review policies, SoA, risk assessment
2. **Stage 2 Audit** (Implementation Review): Verify controls are in place and effective
3. **Certification Decision**: Certificate issued if compliant (3-year validity)
4. **Surveillance Audits**: Annual audits to maintain certification
5. **Recertification Audit**: Full audit every 3 years

---

## Key Documentation Required

- Information Security Policy
- Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Plan
- Statement of Applicability (SoA)
- Asset Inventory
- Access Control Policy
- Incident Response Plan
- Business Continuity Plan
- Records of training
- Audit reports
- Management review reports

## ISO 27001 vs ISO 27002

| ISO 27001 | ISO 27002 |
|-----------|-----------|
| Certifiable standard | Best practice guidelines |
| Specifies ISMS requirements | Provides control implementation guidance |
| Mandatory for certification | Reference for implementation details |
| Includes Annex A (control list) | Detailed control descriptions and best practices |

---

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Access Control
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Least privilege principle
- User access reviews (quarterly)
- MFA for privileged accounts

### Cryptography
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Key management procedures
- Cryptographic algorithm standards

### Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging
- Log retention (minimum 6-12 months)
- Regular log review
- SIEM implementation

### Vulnerability Management
- Regular vulnerability scans
- Patch management processes
- Penetration testing (annual)

### Incident Management
- Incident response team
- Incident classification
- Response procedures
- Post-incident review
