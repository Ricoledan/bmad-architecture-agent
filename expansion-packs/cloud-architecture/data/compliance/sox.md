## SOX IT General Controls (ITGC)

### 1. Access Controls
- **User Access Management**: Role-based access, least privilege
- **Privileged Access**: Monitoring and logging of admin accounts
- **Password Policies**: Strong passwords, regular changes
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly reviews of user access rights
- **Segregation of Duties (SoD)**: No single person can complete critical transactions alone

**Key SoD Conflicts** (Must Be Separated):
- Developer cannot deploy to production
- User admin cannot have access to financial data
- Database admin cannot modify application code

### 2. Change Management
- Documented change request and approval process
- Testing in non-production environments
- Segregation between development and production
- Emergency change procedures documented
- Rollback procedures

**Change Management Steps**:
1. Request submitted and documented
2. Risk assessment and impact analysis
3. Approval from change advisory board (CAB)
4. Testing in dev/staging environment
5. Scheduled deployment with rollback plan
6. Post-implementation review

### 3. Computer Operations
- Batch job monitoring and error handling
- Backup and recovery procedures tested
- IT incident management
- Problem management
- Capacity and performance monitoring

### 4. System Development and Acquisition
- System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) documented
- Requirements gathering and approval
- Design and code reviews
- Testing and UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- Security testing before production

### 5. Physical and Logical Security
- Data center physical security
- Network security (firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Vulnerability management
- Anti-malware and endpoint protection

## Application Controls

### Input Controls
- Data validation and edit checks
- Error handling and correction
- Duplicate detection
- Authorization for data entry

### Processing Controls
- Transaction integrity
- Reconciliation controls
- Calculation accuracy
- Completeness checks

### Output Controls
- Report distribution controls
- Output review and approval
- Reconciliation with source data

---

## Audit and Compliance

### Internal Audit Requirements
- Test design and operating effectiveness of controls
- Quarterly or annual testing cycles
- Document test results and findings
- Remediate control deficiencies

### External Audit Requirements
- Independent external auditor assessment
- Testing of management's controls
- Issuance of audit opinion (unqualified, qualified, adverse)

### Control Deficiencies
- **Deficiency**: Control doesn't allow prevention or detection of misstatements
- **Significant Deficiency**: More than remote likelihood of material misstatement
- **Material Weakness**: Reasonable possibility of material misstatement not prevented/detected
