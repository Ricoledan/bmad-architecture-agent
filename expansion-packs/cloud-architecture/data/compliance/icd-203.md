# ICD 203: Intelligence Community Directive 203

## Overview

ICD 203, "Analytic Standards," establishes standards for Intelligence Community (IC) analytic products to ensure they are timely, objective, independent of political consideration, and based on all available sources of information. This directive is critical for law enforcement and intelligence agencies producing analytical reports and intelligence products.

**Effective Date**: January 2, 2015
**Issuing Authority**: Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
**Applicability**: All IC elements and their analysts

---

## Core Analytic Standards

ICD 203 establishes nine fundamental analytic standards that must be applied to all IC analytic products:

### 1. Objective

**Standard**: Analytic products must be objective and independent of political consideration.

**Requirements**:
- Present findings without bias or predetermined conclusions
- Avoid policy prescription or advocacy
- Separate analysis from policy recommendations
- Disclose when analysis supports policy positions
- Identify when conclusions are influenced by previous assessments

**Technical Implementation**:
- Implement review workflows that check for policy bias
- Flag language that contains prescriptive policy recommendations
- Maintain audit trails of analytical reasoning
- Use version control to track analytical evolution

---

### 2. Independent of Political Consideration

**Standard**: Analysis must be conducted without regard to political implications.

**Requirements**:
- Shield analysts from political pressure
- Protect dissenting views
- Encourage alternative analysis
- Document instances of attempted interference
- Establish independence in reporting chains

**Technical Implementation**:
- Role-based access controls separating policy and intelligence
- Audit logging of document access and edits
- Protected channels for dissenting opinions
- Automated alerts for unusual access patterns

---

### 3. Timely

**Standard**: Provide information when policymakers need it.

**Requirements**:
- Establish SLAs for different product types
- Prioritize urgent intelligence requirements
- Balance timeliness with accuracy
- Communicate delays and reasons
- Track production timelines

**Technical Implementation**:
- Workflow tracking with due dates
- Automated escalation for overdue products
- Priority queuing systems
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Metrics dashboards for production times

---

### 4. Based on All Available Sources

**Standard**: Consider all relevant information, including alternative hypotheses.

**Requirements**:
- Integrate information from all collection disciplines (HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, etc.)
- Consider open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Identify information gaps
- Document sources consulted
- Integrate dissenting assessments

**Technical Implementation**:
- Multi-source data integration pipelines
- Source tracking and attribution

---

### 5. Properly Describes Quality of Sources

**Standard**: Clearly describe the quality and reliability of sources.

**Requirements**:

- Identify single-source information
- Note corroboration or lack thereof
- Use standardized source descriptors

**Source Descriptors**:

---

### 6. Properly Expresses Uncertainties

**Standard**: Clearly convey confidence levels and uncertainties.

**Requirements**:

- Quantify uncertainty where possible

**Confidence Levels** (ICD 203 Standard Language):
- **High confidence**: Generally indicates judgments based on high-quality information and/or the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment
- **Moderate confidence**: Generally means credibly sourced information but information is not of sufficient quality or is too fragmented to make solid analytic inferences, or significant concerns or problems with sources existed
- **Low confidence**: Generally means questionable or fragmented information was used, significant concerns or problems with sources existed, or the IC has limited insight

**Technical Implementation**:
- Confidence tagging in documents
- Assumption tracking
- Alternative analysis documentation
- Probabilistic modeling tools
- Uncertainty visualization

---

### 7. Properly Distinguishes Between Underlying Intelligence and Analysts' Assumptions and Judgments

**Standard**: Clearly distinguish facts from assessments.

**Requirements**:

- Explicitly state assumptions
- Label assessments as such
- Document analytical reasoning
- Trace judgments to supporting information

**Technical Implementation**:

---

### 8. Incorporates Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)

**Standard**: Consider alternative hypotheses and contrary information.

**Requirements**:

- Customer feedback loops
- Relevance tagging
- Question-answer mapping
