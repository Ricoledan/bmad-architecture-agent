# Event-Driven Architecture Pattern

## Overview

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. In 2025, EDA has become the foundation for building resilient, scalable, and responsive distributed systems that can handle complex business processes across cloud-native and hybrid environments.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios

- **User activity tracking** and real-time analytics
- **Workflow orchestration** with complex business rules
- **System integration** across multiple domains and boundaries
- **Audit and compliance** systems requiring event trails
- **Reactive applications** responding to changing data states

### Avoid When
- **Simple CRUD applications** with limited business logic
- **Transactional systems** requiring strict ACID properties
- **Batch processing** with predictable schedules
- **Systems requiring immediate consistency** across all components
- **Simple request-response patterns** without complex workflows
