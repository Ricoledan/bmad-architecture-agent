# Example Usage:
#
# adr:
#   number: "ADR-001"
#   title: "Use PostgreSQL for primary database"
#   date: "2024-01-15"
#   status: "accepted"
#
# context:
#   description: |
#     We need to select a primary database for our e-commerce application.
#     The system needs to handle transactional data with strong consistency,
#     support complex queries, and scale to millions of records.
#
# decision:
#   choice: "We will use PostgreSQL as our primary relational database"
#   rationale: |
#     PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance, excellent JSON support,
#     mature ecosystem, and is proven at scale. It meets all our
#     functional and non-functional requirements.
