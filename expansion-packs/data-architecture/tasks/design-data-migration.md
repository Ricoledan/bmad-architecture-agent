# Design Data Migration Task

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive data migration strategy with zero-downtime approach, data validation, and rollback procedures.

## Task Flow

### Step 1: Migration Assessment
1. Analyze source and target schemas
2. Identify data quality issues in source
3. Estimate data volume and migration time
4. Assess business impact and downtime requirements
5. Identify technical constraints and dependencies

### Step 2: Migration Strategy Selection
**Big Bang Migration**:
- Complete cutover in single event
- Requires downtime window
- Simpler but higher risk

**Phased Migration**:
- Migrate data incrementally by module/table
- Gradual cutover reduces risk
- More complex coordination

**Parallel Run**:
- Dual-write to both systems during transition
- No downtime, highest safety
- More complex, requires sync mechanism

### Step 3: Schema Mapping
1. Map source tables/columns to target schema
2. Design data transformation rules
3. Handle data type conversions
4. Plan for schema differences (new fields, removed fields)
5. Document unmapped data and disposition

### Step 4: Data Transformation Design
1. Cleanse data quality issues
2. Convert formats and data types
3. Split or merge tables as needed
4. Generate surrogate keys if needed
5. Handle referential integrity constraints

### Step 5: Migration Execution Plan
1. **Pre-Migration**:
   - Backup source database
   - Provision target database
   - Test transformation scripts
2. **Initial Load**:
   - Historical data migration (can be slow)
   - Validate data integrity post-load
3. **Incremental Sync** (if using phased/parallel):
   - CDC or timestamp-based incremental updates
   - Minimize lag between source and target
4. **Cutover**:
   - Final sync
   - Application switch to new database
   - Monitor for issues
5. **Post-Migration**:
   - Decommission old database
   - Update documentation

### Step 6: Validation Strategy
1. Row count reconciliation
2. Checksum validation for data integrity
3. Sample record comparison
4. Business logic validation
5. Performance testing on target
6. Application smoke tests

### Step 7: Rollback Plan
1. Define rollback criteria (data loss, performance issues, bugs)
2. Keep source database operational during cutover period
3. Document rollback procedures
4. Test rollback in non-production environment
5. Define rollback decision authority

## Output
1. Migration Plan Document
2. Schema Mapping Spreadsheet
3. Transformation Scripts (SQL, Python)
4. Validation Test Cases
5. Rollback Procedures
6. Cutover Runbook with timeline and responsibilities

## Quality Criteria
- Zero data loss
- Referential integrity maintained
- Performance meets requirements
- Rollback tested and ready
- Stakeholder approval obtained
