# Graph Databases

## Overview

Graph databases are purpose-built to store and navigate relationships. They use graph structures with nodes (entities), edges (relationships), and properties to represent and store data. Graph databases excel at queries that traverse relationships, making them ideal for connected data use cases.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes (Vertices)
- Represent entities (people, products, locations, etc.)
- Contain properties (key-value pairs)
- Can have labels/types to categorize entities
- Example: Person node with properties {name: "Alice", age: 30}

### Edges (Relationships)
- Connect nodes to represent relationships
- Have direction (from source to target)
- Contain properties describing the relationship
- Have types/labels (FRIENDS_WITH, PURCHASED, WORKS_FOR)
- Example: Alice -[FRIENDS_WITH {since: 2020}]-> Bob

### Properties
- Key-value pairs attached to nodes or edges
- Store attributes and metadata
- Can be indexed for fast lookups
- Support various data types (strings, numbers, dates, arrays)

### Labels/Types
- Categorize nodes and relationships
- Enable efficient filtering and querying
- Support multiple labels per node
- Example: Person, Employee, Customer labels on same node

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing
- Index frequently queried properties
- Composite indexes for multi-property lookups
- Full-text indexes for search
- Trade-off: Faster reads, slower writes

### Data Modeling
- Avoid over-connecting (too many relationships)
- Use relationship properties to filter
- Denormalize when appropriate
- Model for your query patterns

### Query Optimization
- Limit traversal depth when possible
- Use index hints
- Filter early in traversal
- Avoid Cartesian products

### Scaling Strategies
- **Read replicas**: Scale read-heavy workloads
- **Sharding/Partitioning**: Distribute large graphs
- **Caching**: Cache frequent traversals
- **Denormalization**: Pre-compute common paths

---

## Integration Patterns

### Graph + Relational
- Use RDBMS for transactional data
- Use graph for relationship-heavy queries
- Sync via ETL or CDC (Change Data Capture)
- Example: User profiles in PostgreSQL, social connections in Neo4j

### Graph + Document Store
- Document store for flexible schemas
- Graph for relationships between documents
- Example: MongoDB for product data, Neptune for recommendations

### Graph + Data Warehouse
- Graph for operational queries
- Warehouse for analytics and BI
- Example: Neo4j for real-time fraud detection, Snowflake for historical analysis

### Graph + Search
- Graph for traversals
- Search engine for full-text
- Example: Neptune + Elasticsearch for semantic search

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Fraud Detection
**Pattern**: Identify suspicious relationship patterns
**Example**: Multiple accounts sharing phone numbers, addresses, devices
**Queries**:
- Find rings of connected accounts
- Detect velocity of transactions across network
- Identify mule accounts

### 2. Recommendation Engines
**Pattern**: Collaborative filtering via graph traversal
**Example**: "Users who liked X also liked Y"
**Queries**:
- Friend-of-friend recommendations
- Item similarity based on co-purchases
- Personalized content suggestions

### 3. Network and IT Operations
**Pattern**: Model infrastructure dependencies
**Example**: Service dependencies, root cause analysis
**Queries**:
- Impact analysis (what breaks if this fails?)
- Shortest path between services
- Identify single points of failure

### 4. Knowledge Graphs
**Pattern**: Semantic relationships between entities
**Example**: Wikipedia-style knowledge base
**Queries**:
- Find related concepts
- Reasoning and inference
- Question answering

### 5. Identity and Access Management
**Pattern**: Complex permission hierarchies
**Example**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
**Queries**:
- What can user X access?
- Who has access to resource Y?
- Inherited permissions via groups

### 6. Master Data Management
**Pattern**: Link and deduplicate entities
**Example**: Customer 360 view
**Queries**:
- Find all records for same person
- Merge duplicate entities
- Track data lineage

## Migration Strategies

### From Relational to Graph

1. **Identify relationships** that are foreign keys
2. **Convert tables to nodes** (entities become nodes)
3. **Convert join tables to edges** (many-to-many relationships)
4. **Model hierarchies** as edges (parent-child, org charts)
5. **Migrate data** in batches with validation
6. **Optimize queries** to leverage traversals

### From Document Store to Graph

1. **Extract relationships** from embedded documents
2. **Create edges** for references between documents
3. **Preserve document properties** as node properties
4. **Use hybrid approach** (documents + graph) if needed

### From One Graph DB to Another

1. **Export in universal format** (GraphML, JSON, CSV)
2. **Map query languages** (Cypher â Gremlin, etc.)
3. **Test performance** with representative queries
4. **Migrate in phases** with dual-write period

---

## Best Practices

### Data Modeling
- Model relationships explicitly (not as properties)
- Use meaningful relationship types
- Keep node/edge properties simple
- Avoid super-nodes (nodes with millions of edges)
- Model for your queries, not for normalization

### Query Performance
- Use parameters in queries (prevent injection + caching)
- Index properties used in WHERE clauses
- Limit traversal depth
- Profile and optimize slow queries
- Consider denormalization for hot paths

### Security
- Implement role-based access control
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Use VPC/private networks
- Audit all access
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Monitoring
- Track query performance
- Monitor memory usage
- Alert on slow traversals
- Measure cache hit rates
- Monitor replication lag (if using replicas)

### Maintenance
- Regular backups with point-in-time recovery
- Test disaster recovery procedures
- Keep statistics up to date
- Monitor and compact storage
- Plan for version upgrades
